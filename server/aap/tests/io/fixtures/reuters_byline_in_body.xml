              <p>(Adds Gov. Cuomo's announcement that the Statue of Liberty will
reopen on Monday, details on park closures)</p>
              <p>By Joseph Ax</p>
              <p>NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Statue of Liberty will
reopen on Monday even if the U.S. government shutdown extends
into the work week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on
Sunday, vowing to use state funds to keep the landmark monument
in operation.</p>
              <p>Dozens of other national parks and monuments were expected
to remain partially or entirely closed after Congress failed to
agree on a spending plan to keep the government running past a
Friday midnight deadline.</p>
              <p>In the hours leading up to the shutdown, the Trump
administration worked on ways to keep hundreds of parks open
without staff in an effort to avoid public anger, although it
was unclear which ones would close.</p>
              <p>"Not all parks are fully open but we are all working hard to
make as many areas as accessible to the public as possible,"
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Twitter on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The hit-or-miss closures forced tourists and residents alike
to alter their plans. In lower Manhattan, where ferries normally
embark for the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, out-of-town
visitors expressed frustration that the site was closed.</p>
              <p>And San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman posted a photo
of a "closed" sign outside Cabrillo National Monument on
Twitter.</p>
              <p>"I had planned to do some tide pool repeats to get some hill
work in on my bicycle ride this morning," she wrote, referring
to a local bike route. "Change of plans."</p>
              <p>The National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy
group, estimated that one-third of the 417 national park sites
were shuttered, "including places like the Statue of Liberty,
presidential homes, and other historic and cultural sites
primarily made up of buildings that can be locked."</p>
              <p>Yellowstone National Park, a 3,500-square-mile (9,065 square
km) wilderness located mostly in Montana, remained open but
offered limited services, with visitor centers closed and park
rangers absent. The association warned that the lack of staff
could pose dangers to visitors.</p>
              <p>Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, a private company that manages
lodges, concessions and restaurants in numerous national parks
including Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, Rocky
Mountain and Zion, said they will remain open during the
shutdown.</p>
              <p>In Washington, the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo
will remain open through Monday, using prior-year funds. In a
tweet, the Smithsonian said it will update its status beyond
Monday "as soon as we know." But in Philadelphia, visitors were
turned away at the Liberty Bell.</p>
              <p>During the last shutdown in 2013, a number of governors used
state funds to keep parks open, including the Statue of Liberty,
which at the time cost $61,600 per day to reopen.</p>
              <p>At a news conference at the Statue of Liberty, Cuomo said
the site generates tourism revenue, adding that the monument
serves as a welcoming beacon to immigrants arriving in the
United States.</p>
              <p>"We don't want to lose the income," he said. "And
symbolically, you can shut down the government, but you can't
shut down the Statue of Liberty."</p>
              <p>In Arizona, Republican Governor Doug Ducey committed state
funds to keep the Grand Canyon open, including trash removal,
snow plowing and public restrooms, according to Ducey spokesman
Patrick Ptak.</p>
              <p>"We recognize it&#8217;s a huge economic attractor and has a big
impact not just on rural areas around the Grand Canyon but the
state as a whole," Ptak said, adding that the expected cost is
around $100,000 per week.</p>
              <p>But in South Dakota, home of Mount Rushmore, Republican
Governor Dennis Daugaard has said he would not take any action
to keep the monument open during a shutdown.
