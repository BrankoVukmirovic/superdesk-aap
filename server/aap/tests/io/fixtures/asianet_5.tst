OMRON Launches Promotional Website for AI-equipped Mobile Robot LD Series

KYOTO, Japan, Feb. 1, 2017 /Kyodo JBN-AsiaNet/ --

OMRON Corporation announced on February 1 the launch of a promotional website 
(http://www.ia.omron.com/products/family/3664/) for the AI-equipped Mobile 
Robot LD Series, a family of Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIVs) that 
represents a significant step towards achieving human-machine harmony in 
manufacturing. Since the LD Series was announced in October last year, 
customers from a number of industries, ranging from automotive and electronics 
to foods and pharmaceuticals, have begun deploying the Mobile Robots in their 
manufacturing facilities.

The Mobile Robots are transport vehicle equipped with proprietary artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology that allows it to transport materials to a target 
location while calculating the optimal route and avoiding humans and obstacles. 
The robots are ideally suited for a wide range of indoor environments, 
including manufacturing and logistics facilities for the automotive, 
electronics, food and pharmaceutical industries. The Mobile Robots contribute 
towards the resolution of social issues by liberating human workers from the 
simple, monotonous and exhausting labor of carrying items, giving them the 
freedom to engage in more creative work. In addition, the AIVs work together 
with fixed material-handling equipment and for the first time offer users true 
flexibility in factory design.

The Mobile Robots promotional website will offer information on product 
specifications and key technologies (*1), introduce case examples of the Mobile 
Robots in practical use and suggest tips for how customers can install the 
system in their own manufacturing or storage facility.

Solution examples
Car-manufacturing plants:
Capable of moving up to 130 kg of cargo, the Mobile Robots can free human 
workers from the tedious heavy labor required in car manufacturing plants to 
move hefty car parts from subassembly areas to the lineside.

Semiconductor plants:
The Mobile Robots are capable of navigating the busy, narrow passages commonly 
found in semiconductor plants, transporting wafer pods (FOUPS) between 
processing stages reliably and with full traceability. 

Food-manufacturing plants:
As new products are launched according to the flow of seasonal demand, food 
producers often face the need to adjust their manufacturing processes. The 
Mobile Robots gather information on their surroundings and automatically 
generate a map with just one run through any given environment. This enables 
swift and flexible adjustments of manufacturing processes and offers a 
meaningful alternative to inflexible conveyor belt networks.

Distribution warehouses:
Careful sorting based on a shipping address is a necessity in distribution 
warehouses. A single dedicated controller unit can track the locations of up to 
100 Mobile Robot units working cooperatively in a fleet to optimally manage the 
transport of goods, reducing unnecessary traffic and delivery errors.

Besides the promotional website, Mobile Robot demonstrations will be set up in 
eight Automation Centers (*2), located around the world, providing assistance 
to customers facing manufacturing issues. The Automation Centers offer 
customers in their respective areas individually tailored suggestions on how to 
utilize OMRON systems, and are also equipped with a full range of 
robotics-testing equipment to provide support from system evaluation and 
verification to safe design and installation. In addition, OMRON is planning to 
introduce Mobile Robots to its Kusatsu factory, western Japan, and will welcome 
customers to the facility to view the systems in operation as a way of 
promoting the popularization of the technology in a variety of manufacturing 
settings.

OMRON envisions a future driven by automation where machines are in harmonious 
interaction with humans and understand their movements and thoughts. As a part 
of this vision, OMRON develops unique solutions combining advanced automation 
technology and robotics.

Note (*1): Natural Feature Navigation technology enables Mobile Robots to 
automatically maneuver around humans and obstacles. Fleet Management technology 
allows the collaborative operation and optimal control of up to 100 Mobile 
Robot units. Easy-to-use design can enable production line changes in minutes.

Note (*2): Automation Centers showcase OMRON's broad portfolio of unique FA 
equipment and are furnished with live equipment and actual products for 
demonstrations, along with training rooms. They provide control applications to 
resolve manufacturing issues faced by customers. The eighth center, Automation 
Center Korea, was opened in January 2017 in Seoul.
