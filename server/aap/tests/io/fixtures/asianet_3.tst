MEDIA RELEASE PR67255
Animal rights come to Brazil's Carnival for a show with no feathers

SAO PAULO, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-AsiaNet/ --

    -- Aguia de Ouro samba school to present theme on raising awareness of
       animal rights. The most committed can join the parade with their pets
       through the initiative, "Your Pet on the Avenue" 

Brazil's Carnival is recognized worldwide. It astonishes the world with its 
beauty, grandeur and the joy of all those people, as the biggest Carnival 
celebration in the world. It has years and years of tradition behind it, with 
all kinds of celebrations all over the land. But undoubtedly, the parades that 
take place in the sambadromes, both in Sao Paulo as well as Rio de Janeiro, 
attract the most international attention with the shows they put on. Defying 
Brazil's Carnival conventions, and embracing a greater awareness of animal 
rights, the Paulistana samba school, Aguia de Ouro ('Golden Eagle') - 
www.aguiadeouro.com.br - has teamed up with one of the country's major 
activists to help increase the visibility of this subject. The school will not 
use any feathers at all in its show.

It is estimated that every year, the 26 parades of special groups in Sao Paulo 
(14) and Rio de Janeiro (12) cost something on the order of US$35 million. In 
this setting, more than 19 tons of feathers are used for embellishment and to 
make the party happen from an aesthetic standpoint. A Carnival without feathers 
seems impossible to most carnavalescos, who use them in countless circumstances 
- whether it is to produce more dazzling costumes or even to hide the trim on 
the floats.  

In each parade about 750 kilos of feathers are used, selling at an average rate 
of US$330 per kilo, in other words, each samba school consumes more or less 
US$330,000 in feathers, which works out to more than US$8.5 million just for 
the major productions. "These statistics are just for the special groups, but 
throughout all of Brazil there are so many celebrations with shows, and 
feathers are always present. It's an endless story, with a lot of death behind 
the celebration," as carnavalesco Amarildo explains.

Specifically for the festival, the most commonly used are duck, pheasant and 
ostrich feathers. The ostrich feathers are grand and imposing. Contrary to 
appearances, though, they are not "given away" by the creature as if they had 
fallen out naturally. On the contrary, they are mostly pulled out by force. 
Ostriches go through this process their whole life long. Pheasants, on the 
other hand, and also geese, are often bred in captivity just to have their 
feathers yanked out. "We had to do a lot of work to develop alternatives for a 
Carnival without feathers. We replaced them with elements made from plastic PET 
bottles," he concludes. 

Your Pet on the Avenue

One float will be devoted to stories from the movies featuring animals as great 
stars. It will be carrying a big screen displaying more than 80,000 photos of 
persons engaged in the cause with their pets. The project "Your Pet on the 
Avenue" will help the school, and some of the proceeds will be allocated to the 
Rancho dos Gnomos Ecological Sanctuary Association (Associacao Santuario 
Ecologico Rancho dos Gnomos), which takes in animals of various species.  

To participate, just click on the link www.petintheparade.com, fill out the 
registration form, make a donation of US$15, US$30 or US$60 via Paypal, and 
send the photo you'd like to see appearing in the parade. Aguia de Ouro will be 
the 7th samba school to appear on the Avenue on February 24, on the first day 
of parades by the schools in Sao Paulo's Special Group. When the school enters 
the avenue, the participants will receive an e-mail announcing the start of the 
parade. "We want the whole world to be on the avenue with their pets, whatever 
they may be," Amarildo exclaims.

Honors and Attractions 

With the slogan "Love is repaid with love," the school will bring to the avenue 
a variety of references touching on this subject. Dogs, because they have such 
a strong bond with people, are in first place, but many other animals will also 
put in an appearance.  

Among those honored are the whale Tilikun, the gorilla Harambe, and the 
Brazilian jaguar Juma. One single float portrays the story of these animals: 
the orca from Orlando's SeaWorld in the U.S., featured in the documentary 
'Blackfish; the gorilla, who was killed in a zoo in Cincinnati (OH) after he 
grabbed a 4 year-old boy who fell into his enclosure; and the jaguar who was 
put down by the Brazilian Army after the Olympic torch passed through the city 
of Manaus, Brazil, during the 2016 Olympic celebrations.   

Their stories, as matters of worldwide concern, are told to draw in an ever 
increasing number of persons to reflect on how much animals suffer when kept 
out of their natural habitat, which often leads to their death.  

"Animal rights have made it to samba," exclaims the school's carnavalesco, 
Amarildo de Mello. He goes on to say that this giant step forward proves how 
Brazil is on the path to greater awareness, but makes it plain that the country 
is still a beginner in this subject when compared to the rest of the world. "We 
are continuing in the effort to prove to the greatest possible number of people 
that animals deserve our respect," concludes Luisa Mell, ambassador of the 
school and one of Brazil's leading activists in this cause.  

Other stories will be represented in the parade. Besides the movies, the school 
also addresses the issue of circuses, emphasizing that the ring is not the 
forest, and taking a position against the use of animals in circus spectacles. 
There will also be a wing of the parade in honor of seeing-eye dogs, who will 
be leading blind people and their relatives in the parade.  

Characters such as Snoopy, Scooby-Doo, Rin Tin Tin, Santa's Helper (from the 
Simpsons), as well as animals created by Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio de 
Sousa, will also appear.  

            Samba theme song 2017 - Aguia de Ouro 

            Dawn has broken, the sun is up
            I'm a passionate one in the parade
            Who truly loves you
            And will never make you suffer
            If a flood comes I won't forget you
            Like Noah did
            Lost in towers of Babel
            But I will always be with you
            Character of great stories
            Thrills on the silver screen
            Star that inspires
            It's yours, the walk of fame of my carnival

            Makes children laugh
            When the villain fails
            A valiant hero, and oh so funny
            Attraction of animated cartoons

            Today my Aguia comes to ask
            For mankind to reflect
            It is a new era, a new view
            The ring is no forest
            Nor is the pool an ocean
            Like Luisa Mell does
            Defend all animals
            Protect these companions
            Who guide and assist
            And who risk their lives for us
            They are angels sent from heaven
            Who clamor for a better future

            An artist's soul
            Lady or the Tramp
            Friend of the world
            Your gaze is a caress
            Court the moon in my shed
            Love that never ends
