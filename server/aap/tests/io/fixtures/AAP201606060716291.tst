TI#UGL continues project delay negotiation
AB#UGL’s construction of the Ichthys SMP and CCPP projects continues to experience substantial delays and disruption.
TX#
UGL’s construction of the Ichthys SMP and CCPP projects (in joint venture with Kentz and CH2M Hill respectively) continues to experience substantial delays and disruption attributable to the client, JKC (a JV between JGC, KBR and Chiyoda).
Substantial claims have been raised with JKC on both SMP and CCPP. UGL maintains a strong contractual position with issues clearly attributable to client delays and disruption.
Substantive commercial negotiation of the SMP claims is ongoing however, negotiations have become protracted. As previously stated, margin will not be recognised on the SMP project while commercial negotiations are ongoing.
