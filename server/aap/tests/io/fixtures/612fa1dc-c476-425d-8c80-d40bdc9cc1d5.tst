A former Melbourne terror suspect no longer needs to wear a tracking device, despite police believing it could reduce the risk of an attack.

   Harun Causevic was last year charged in connection with an Anzac Day terror plot, but the charge was dropped because there wasn't enough evidence.

   The 19-year-old was then ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device but a judge has ordered the device be removed, although she ruled a control order should continue until September this year.
