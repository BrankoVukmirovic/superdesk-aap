OnApp v5.3 Simplifies Add-on Services for Cloud Providers

LONDON, Feb. 1 /PRNewswire-AsiaNet / --

- Makes it easy for cloud service providers and enterprises to offer a catalog 
of applications and managed services for customers and users to deploy with 
cloud servers  

    OnApp [http://onapp.com ] has launched v5.3 of the OnApp cloud management 
platform [http://onapp.com/platform ], which helps cloud providers add value to 
their customers and users by delivering application services and managed 
services along with virtual servers in their OnApp clouds. OnApp's new Service 
Add-On and Service Catalog features enable cloud providers to offer a range of 
add-on services, such as software installs or managed Linux/Windows 
administration, in a fully automated way - reducing manual effort, and
enabling them to tailor their clouds to the specific needs of different 
customers and users.

    OnApp v5.3 is available now as a free upgrade to the global community of 
OnApp cloud providers, and via a range of easy-to-deploy packages for new 
customers. More information is available at http://onapp.com/v53.

    "We're constantly looking for ways to help OnApp cloud providers get a 
bigger return on their investment in cloud infrastructure - and our new service 
catalog features are another great example," said OnApp CEO, Ditlev Bredahl.

    "As a cloud service provider, you can differentiate from vanilla
Infrastructure-as-a-Service by building a service catalog around your own 
expertise in applications and infrastructure. For enterprise cloud providers, 
it's a way to provide a curated catalog of approved services for your users and 
departments to deploy - and in both scenarios, it's a way to save time and 
money by automating service delivery, billing and chargeback."

    The new version of OnApp also introduces Virtual Server Gateways, which 
enable cloud providers to offer private networks in their cloud that have 
secure public network access; auto-healing capabilities for OnApp Storage, the 
high-performance SAN built into the OnApp platform; new reporting capabilities 
for OnApp CDN; HTTPS support for OnApp Accelerator, the one-click CDN solution 
for web applications hosted in OnApp clouds; and a range of improvements for 
customers running vCloud Director with OnApp as their front-end portal.
