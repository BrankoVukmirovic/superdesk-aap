Legionella bacteria has been found in a regional southwest Queensland hospital.

   Routine testing at the Cunnamulla Hospital at the end of June returned positive results for the bacteria, but the South West Hospital and Health Service says the risks for staff, patients and visitors are low.

   Hospital authorities are hyper-chlorinating the water system and replacing the affected tap ware according to standard protocols for removing the Legionella bacteria.
