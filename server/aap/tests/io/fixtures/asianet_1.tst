Integration

AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-AsiaNet/ --

Digital Turbine, Inc. ( https://www.digitalturbine.com/ ) (Nasdaq: APPS), a 
leader in mobile monetization solutions, today announced a strategic 
partnership with Axiata Digital, the digital services unit of Axiata Group 
Berhad (Axiata), one of Asia's largest telecommunications groups. As part of a 
multi-year agreement, Digital Turbine will integrate its carrier billing 
solution, Pay(TM) ( https://www.digitalturbine.com/products/pay/ ), with 
Axiata's Mobile Internet Fulfillment Exchange (MIFE) platform, enabling content 
providers access to new subscribers.

Digital Turbine's Pay platform integration with Axiata Digital's API platform, 
Mobile Internet Fulfilment Exchange (MIFE), enables customers to make purchases 
by charging payments to their mobile phone.  MIFE in turn provides a single 
point of integration for service providers to gain access to over 300 million 
subscribers across Axiata's Asian markets. Launch is expected in the first half 
of 2017. 

Chief Executive Officer of Axiata Digital, Mohd Khairil Abdullah says, "We are 
excited to partner with Digital Turbine and to further monetize our unique 
open-source API platform through this partnership within the digital ecosystem. 
With the MIFE available at each of Axiata's operating companies, leading mobile 
platform providers like Digital Turbine are able to instantly access millions 
of mobile customers in Asia and accelerate the pace of service delivery through 
one central point." 

"In countries where credit cards are less prevalent and its harder-to-monetize, 
direct carrier billing is a great option for both mobile operators and end 
customers. Pay delivers greater ease-of-use for users and better conversation 
rates for content partners," said Jon Mooney, EVP of APAC at Digital Turbine. 
"Our Pay platform provides a simple gateway via a single API for partners to 
access many operators globally."

"By delivering unique technology platforms to valued partners in key 
geographies, we are laying the foundation for scalable growth. We are very 
excited to partner with Axiata, with its focus on digital products and services 
to provide a valuable and engaging experience for its subscribers," said Bill 
Stone, CEO of Digital Turbine."Our Pay platform provides access to new and 
engaging content and importantly a way to securely pay for it through direct 
carrier billing. This agreement reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy 
to expand our footprint in this fast-growing region."
