Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Awarded to the Creators of Digital 
Imaging Sensors

LONDON, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

    Four engineers responsible for the creation of digital imaging sensors were 
today honoured with the world's most prestigious engineering prize. The Queen 
Elizabeth Prize for Engineering is a £1million prize, celebrating 
world-changing engineering innovations.
    Eric Fossum (USA), George Smith (USA), Nobukazu Teranishi (Japan) and 
Michael Tompsett (UK) were announced as the winners by Lord Browne of 
Madingley, in the presence of HRH The Princess Royal, at the Royal Academy of 
Engineering.
Their innovations revolutionised the visual world; the charge coupled device 
(CCD), the pinned photodiode (PPD) and the complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor.
    Digital imaging sensors have enabled high-speed, low-cost colour imaging at 
a resolution and sensitivity that can exceed that of the human eye. They offer 
instant access to images ranging from minute cell structures to galaxies 
billions of light years away, transforming medicine, science, communication and 
entertainment.
    The revolution began in the 1970s with the development of the CCD by George 
Smith and its use in imaging by Michael Tompsett. The CCD is the image sensor 
inside early digital cameras, converting particles of light, or photons, into 
electrical signals enabling the image to be stored as digital data.  The 
following decade, Nobukazu Teranishi invented the pinned photodiode (PPD), 
reducing the size of light-capturing 'pixels' and significantly improving image 
quality. The development of the CMOS sensor by Eric Fossum in 1992 allowed 
cameras to be made smaller, cheaper and with better battery life.
Professor Sir Christopher Snowden, Chair of Judges said: "A picture is a 
universal form of communication. It can be shared instantly with anyone around 
the world, no matter what language they speak. We chose this engineering 
innovation because it epitomises what the prize stands for. It is 
inspirational, truly something that everyone can understand, and it has had a 
remarkable social impact worldwide."
    Chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, Lord 
Browne of Madingley said: "The 2017 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering is 
awarded to four engineers who have revolutionised the way we capture and 
analyse visual information. The spirit of international collaboration driving 
the work of George Smith, Michael Tompsett, Nobukazu Teranishi and Eric Fossum 
encapsulates perfectly the ideals of the QEPrize. In honouring them we hope to 
inspire the next generation of engineers to continue to push back the frontiers 
of the possible."
