GTA is a leading quadruple-play telecommunications operator providing wireless, 
high-speed internet, IPTV and fixed voice services in Guam. GTA is also a part 
of a consortium of U.S. and Asian telecommunications companies that are 
constructing SEA-US, a new submarine cable system to connect Southeast Asia and 
the United States via Guam. 

"This transaction represents our first investment in Guam and we are excited to 
be associated with the premier provider of telecommunications services on the 
island.  We are committed to ensuring our customers have the highest-quality 
experience," commented Paul Huntsman, President and CEO of Huntsman Family 
Investments. "In keeping with our family's commitment to the communities in 
which we operate, we hope this investment leads to more opportunities to invest 
back into the Guam community."

Under US-based HFI ownership, GTA will continue to be locally managed, operated 
and dedicated to improving connectivity across the island and internationally. 

"Advantage Partners has been an exceptional partner over the last five years, 
by providing GTA with the necessary resources to transform into a full 
communications service provider and greatly enhancing our high-speed wireless 
and in home internet and TV experience for our customers," said Robert 
Haulbrook, GTA President and CEO. "I am pleased that Advantage Partners has 
identified Huntsman Family Investments as the right new investor for GTA. HFI 
will enable our company to continue the development of the business to better 
serve the needs of our growing consumer, enterprise, and government customer 
base. "

Huntsman Family Investments recently acquired American Pacific Corporation, 
which supplies rocket-grade ammonium perchlorate used in rockets and missiles 
utilized by the Department of Defense and NASA. Paul Huntsman also recently 
acquired the Salt Lake Tribune Newspaper. 

"Guam plays a critical role in representing our country's interests in the 
Pacific and maintaining the integrity of our nation's security initiatives in 
the region. Following our investment in American Pacific Corporation, our 
investment in GTA allows us to continue our broader mission in supporting our 
military," said Benjamin Wu, Partner at Huntsman Family Investments. 
"Furthermore, Guam is a gateway between Asia and the US and it is crucial that 
we continue building GTA's network infrastructure to meet our customers' 
growing demand for secure international connectivity."
